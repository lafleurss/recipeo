# Recipeo (Work in progress)
Introducing the ultimate personal recipe curation app - "Recipeo"! This app allows you to easily add, edit, and organize your favorite recipes, whether it's a recipe passed down from your grandma or something you found online. With a user-friendly interface, you can easily search through your recipes through their tags, edit the receipe to include your own recipe enhancements or delete receipes that you no longer need (... because you're now a vegan!).

You can also organize your receipes by categories like Recently Used, Favorites, or your own custom Category  to organize your recipes. Say goodbye to cluttered recipe cards or lost recipe tweaks and hello to a streamlined, organized recipe collection with Recipeo.
